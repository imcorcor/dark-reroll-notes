Katamari Damacy originally came out in {{year}} for Japan, while this is Katamari Damacy REROLL, a remake of the Japanese version with multi-language support. Each language has voice acting and subtitles. There are a few interesting differences.
1. It's the Japanese Damacy world map but flipped vertically
2. Physics use Unity's engine
	- Some items have their collision flipped, meaning they don't vault the Katamari where the item is
	- We'll point this out in MAS6 and MOON
3. VSync caues something called "Start menu glitch"
	- The start screen only accepts inputs on some frames
	- Higher FPS gives more frames that can receive input
	- Vsync limits the frames, and ones you can advance the start screen on
